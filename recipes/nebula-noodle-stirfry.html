    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine the asteroid dust sauce, cosmic soy sauce,
        meteoric oyster sauce, and intergalactic tamarind paste. Stir well to
        create a celestial sauce.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the interstellar vegetable oil in a spacecraft-like wok or large
        skillet over medium-high heat. Add the minced alien garlic and grated
        interdimensional ginger. Saut√© for about 30 seconds until their cosmic
        aroma fills the air.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the lunar moth larvae, Venusian beetle grubs, and Martian land
        shrimp to the wok. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are cooked
        through and the flavors meld together. These extraterrestrial
        ingredients will provide a truly out-of-this-world experience.
      </li>

      <li>
        Introduce the comet pepper, meteorite carrot, and celestial onion to the
        wok. Continue stir-frying for another 3-4 minutes until the vegetables
        are slightly tender but still maintain their otherworldly crispness.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pour the celestial sauce mixture over the stir-fry and toss everything
        together, ensuring that the intergalactic critters and vegetables are
        thoroughly coated. Cook for an additional 2 minutes to allow the flavors
        to harmonize.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the wok from the heat and add the stellar basil leaves and sliced
        gamma ray chili peppers. Gently toss the stir-fry, allowing the fresh
        herbs and fiery peppers to infuse their extraterrestrial essence.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer the Nebula Noodle Stir-Fry to a serving dish and garnish with a
        sprinkle of stardust for a shimmering, otherworldly touch.
      </li>

      <li>
        Serve this celestial creation with noodles of your choice, such as rice
        noodles or udon, for a cosmically satisfying meal that will transport
        your taste buds to galaxies far, far away.
