    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup fresh earthworms (washed and drained)</li>
      <li>2 cups snail mucus (harvested from organic snails)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons toenail clippings (preferably from a Sasquatch)</li>
      <li>1 cup pickled jellyfish tentacles</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon frog's breath (collected during a full moon)</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons vampire bat guano (dried and ground)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon powdered dragon scales</li>
      <li>1 pinch of powdered unicorn horn</li>
      <li>1 medium-sized onion (diced)</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
      <li>1 cup maggots (freshly hatched)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large, cauldron-like pot over medium heat. Add
        the diced onion and minced garlic. Stir them until they turn translucent
        and release a tantalizing aroma.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the onion and garlic are cooked, add the fresh earthworms and snail
        mucus to the pot. Let them simmer together, creating a slimy concoction
        that will make your taste buds squirm with anticipation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the toenail clippings, pickled jellyfish tentacles, frog's
        breath, vampire bat guano, powdered dragon scales, and pinch of powdered
        unicorn horn. These magical ingredients will provide the dish with its
        uniquely bizarre flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the mixture for about 10
        minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Stir occasionally to
        prevent any ingredient from escaping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully add the maggots to the pot. As they wiggle and squirm, they
        will infuse the dish with a certain je ne sais quoi. Cook for an
        additional 5 minutes or until the maggots are cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the Slithering Slime Surprise with salt and pepper to taste. It's
        important to strike the perfect balance between creepy and delicious!
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve your Slithering Slime Surprise in a black cauldron, garnished with
        a few extra earthworms for an authentic touch. You can pair it with a
        side of crispy tarantula legs or deep-fried newt tails, if desired.
